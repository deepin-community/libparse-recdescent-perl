libparse-recdescent-perl (1.967012+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream Changes:

    - *** NON-BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE CHANGE! *** Change global the
      <skip:> directive to eval similar to other <skip:> directives,
      rather than being single-quoted in the resulting parser.

libparse-recdescent-perl (1.967006+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream Changes:  

    - *** NON-BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE CHANGE! *** Change the caches for
      $prevline and $thisline to be local to the parser, rather than
      lexical vars in Parse::RecDescent.  This prevents previously
      generated parsers from interfering with the line counts of
      later parsers.

    - *** NON-BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE CHANGE! *** A repetition directive
      such as 'id(s /,/)' correctly creates a temporary @item variable
      to hold the 'id's that are matched.  That @item variable is them
      used to set the real $item[] entry for that repetition.  The
      same treatment is now given to %item.  Formerly, in a production like:

          id ',' id(s /,/)

      matched against:

          xxx, yyy, zzz

      The $item{id} entry which should be 'xxx' is overwritten by
      'yyy' and then 'zzz' prior to the action being executed.  Now
      'yyy' and 'zzz' set $item{id}, but in the private %item, which
      goes out of scope once the repetition match completes.

    Realistically, the tutorial from the Perl Journal is not going to be
    in Debian, even in the non-free section.  This tutorial (which was
    included in the Debian package for versions << 1.94.free-1) can be
    read at:

libparse-recdescent-perl (1.94.free-2) unstable; urgency=low

    The tutorial from The Perl Journal, which is shipped with the upstream
    sources, is removed from the package (both source and binary) because
    its licensing terms are not compatible with the DFSG.  A new package
    called libparse-recdescent-perl-tutorial-nonfree containing this
    tutorial has been created.
